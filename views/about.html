                        <p>Welcome! My name is Johnny Pham and I have developed this portfolio site in order to briefly talk about my background, projects I have worked on, and overall abilities as a prospective Software Developer.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>I am a graduate from the University of Northern Iowa with a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science. During my Sophomore year in college I was fortunate enough to obtain an internship at a software company, where I was exposed to software/hardware development field and was able to get hands-on experience working on various projects with some very knowledgable people. Overall, it was a positive learning experience that allowed me to grow in confidence.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>In my free time, I enjoy messing around with an Arduino microcontroller and making it do "cool" things. I also do some research and learn new skills in the web/software space. Non-tech-wise, I also enjoy spending time with my family, playing the guitar and golf.</p>
